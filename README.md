## Installation
This extension uses the NordVPN command line client, which can be set up as follows.

### Install NordVPN
1. Install NordVPN with `sudo apt install nordvpn`.
2. Configure your credentials with `nordvpn login`, following the prompts.
3. Check NordVPN is set up with `nordvpn c`, if it connects successfully then you're good to go.

### Install the extension
#### Easiest way: 
Enable on gnome-extensions at [gNordVPN Local on gnome extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2569/gnordvpn-local/)

#### Manual install:
1. Create a folder for the extension with `mkdir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gnordvpn-local@isopolito`
2. Copy the files from this repo into that folder
3. Enable the extension using `Tweaks` (if you don't have it, install via `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`)

## Troubleshooting

If the extension shows an error state, make sure NordVPN CLI is functioning (`nordvpn status`). The extension relies on NordVPN CLI being operational. If any behavior suddenly changes, check `nordvpn` CLI to see if anything has changed there, sometimes they make intentional changes that need to be handled by the extesion. Other times they have transient errors on their end that eventually clear up.
